The failure by either party to enforce any provisions of this EULA or to exercise any right in respect thereto shall not be construed as constituting a waiver of its rights thereof.

The invalidity, because of any such law or regulation, of provisions of this EULA which are not fundamental to its performance shall not relieve any party from its obligations under the other provisions of this EULA, nor deprive any party of the benefits of such other provisions. 
9.   APPLICABLE LAW, DISPUTES 
This EULA is governed by the laws of Sweden. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with this contract, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be finally settled by arbitration administered by the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (the “SCC”). The Rules for Expedited Arbitrations shall apply, unless the SCC in its discretion determines, taking into account the complexity of the case, the amount in dispute and other circumstances, that the Arbitration Rules shall apply. In the latter case, the SCC shall also decide whether the Arbitral Tribunal shall be composed of one or three arbitrators. The seat of arbitration shall be Stockholm, Sweden, and the language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English, unless the parties otherwise agree. Notwithstanding the foregoing, HANSOFT shall be entitled to bring action before a competent court of law in Uppsala, Sweden, or San Francisco, CA, USA, or Tokyo, Japan, with regard to payment of license fees and with regard to other claims the capital amount of which is less than EUR 50,000.
